## Cupcakes!!!

The app uses Flask, Python, SQL, and SQLAlchemy to manage a database of cupcakes and provide API end points to access that database. 

The front end is written primarily in JavaScript using jQuery and Bootstrap. The HTML is in Jinja templates built by a single route in the Flask app, and further populated with JavaScript/jQuery DOM manipulation.
